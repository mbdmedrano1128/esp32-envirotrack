# EnviroTrack: ESP32 Environmental Logger

EnviroTrack is a modular firmware project for the ESP32, designed to log environmental data using multiple sensors and transmit readings via UART and MQTT. Built with ESP-IDF and FreeRTOS, it emphasizes clean architecture, scalability, and low-level control.

## 📦 Features

- 🌡️ Temperature & Humidity via DHT11  
- 🌞 Light intensity via LDR  
- 🌡️ Analog temperature via LM35DZ  
- 📤 UART logging for debugging  
- 📡 MQTT publishing (planned)  
- 🔌 Modular driver structure  
- 🧵 FreeRTOS task-based design
